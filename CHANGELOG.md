## v1.0.3 - Documentation and dependency polishing
Aligned the approvals messaging across docs and module headers so traceable gating and Instago context stay consistent, and refreshed helper requires to the latest helper releases for consistency.

### Changed
- Harmonized `ReadMe.MD` and `docs/index.html` copy so approvals messaging stresses traceability, lightweight gating, and a clear Instago link.
- Updated the header comments and helper `require` calls ( `b64`, `json`, `log` ) to `latest` tags while keeping APIs untouched.

## v1.0.2 - Messaging refresh for approvals
Clarified the approvals module narrative to highlight traceable human gating, lightweight workflows, and the Instago platform in consistent language.

### Changed
- Updated `ReadMe.MD` and `docs/index.html` intro copy so the human-approval messaging emphasizes traceability and lightweight gating context.

## v1.0.1 - Release metadata refresh
Patch release refreshes approvals module release metadata and changelog keywords; no API or behavior changes.

### Changed
- Updated package version and changelog entry for release tracking.
